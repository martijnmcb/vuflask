- Ensure new dependencies are added to `requirements.txt` and installed locally.
- Run `pytest -q` when relevant routes/models/auth logic changes.
- Apply necessary migrations (`flask db migrate`/`upgrade`) if models change and document them.
- For template/UI updates, review rendered pages and capture screenshots for PRs.
- Verify `/init` guard remains secure (disabled or token-protected outside dev).
